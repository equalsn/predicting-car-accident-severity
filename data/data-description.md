Road accidents are very common. 

Probably almost every one of us has been a witness or a participant of one at some point in our lives.



**According to the WHO and CDC each year, 1.35 million people are killed on roadways around the world.**

Every day, almost 3,700 people are killed globally in road traffic crashes involving cars, buses, motorcycles, 
bicycles, trucks, or pedestrians.
 
More than half of those killed are pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists.

Road traffic injuries are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death globally for all age groups and the 
leading cause of death for children and young people 5â€“29 years of age. 
More people now die in road traffic crashes than from HIV/AIDS


**Road traffic injuries place a huge economic burden on low- and middle-income countries.** 

Each year, according to the latest available cost estimate (1998), road traffic injuries cost $518 billion USD 
worldwide and $65 billion USD in low- and middle-income countries, 
which exceeds the total amount that these countries receive in development assistance.


That was a few reasons why it is very important to develop a reliable system to predict car accident severity 
since it potentially could save millions of lives 
and also make big economic situation improvements for many people and the country itself.
